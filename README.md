I wrote this repository to easily use the netket package (See: https://netket.org). Therefore, I added some useful machines, operators and hamiltonians. Furthermore, I added some functions to simplify the usage.

If you want to use my code, start with looking at test.py. There you find the functions run() and load() to easily start a calculation.
